## 🎯 Key Metrics

- **Average Match Score**: 76.6/100
- **High-Quality Matches (≥80)**: 3 applications (42.9%)

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Supabase API Key Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Worker was using `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (has RLS restrictions)
- **Solution**: Changed to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `gemini_apply_worker.py:390`
- **Impact**: Worker can now see and process all draft applications

### 2. **Database Status Constraint** ✅
- **Problem**: Database didn't allow `'materials_ready'` status
- **Solution**: Applied migration `006_add_materials_ready_status.sql`
- **Impact**: Worker can now save AI-generated materials successfully

### 3. **Missing Match Analysis Storage** ✅
- **Problem**: Worker only saved match score, not full analysis
- **Solution**: Updated `update_application_status()` to store complete `match_analysis` in `artifacts`
- **Impact**: Frontend can now display key strengths, gaps, and recommendations

### 4. **Backend API Enhancement** ✅
- **Problem**: `/user/{user_id}/applications` didn't include job details
- **Solution**: Changed query to use `select('*, jobs!inner(...)')`
- **Impact**: Frontend receives all necessary data in one API call

### 5. **Frontend UI Enhancement** ✅
- **Problem**: Match score display was basic text
- **Solution**: Added color-coded badges (green ≥80, yellow ≥60, red <60)
- **Impact**: Users can quickly identify high-quality matches visually

  2. Generates personalized cover letter (~10s)
  3. Saves to database with `materials_ready` status

### 3. **Review AI-Generated Materials**
```
Dashboard → Applications → Materials Ready → VIEW AI MATERIALS
```
- Review match score and AI analysis
- Read personalized cover letter
- Check recommendations

### 4. **Apply Manually**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Processing Applications

**Check 1: Worker Status**

```
- Should show "RUNNING" with green badge
- If stopped, click "START WORKER"

**Check 2: Draft Applications Exist**
```
Dashboard → Applications → Filter: Draft
```
- If none, queue some jobs first

**Check 3: Backend Logs**
```bash
tail -f /Users/raj/Documents/Sreeraj\ -\ guthib/careerpilot/backend/logs/worker.log
```
- Should show "Found X draft applications"
- Look for errors

**Check 4: Database Connection**
```bash
cd backend
python -c "
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from supabase import create_client

load_dotenv()
supabase = create_client(os.getenv('SUPABASE_URL'), os.getenv('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY'))
apps = supabase.table('applications').select('*').eq('status', 'draft').execute()
print(f'Found {len(apps.data)} draft applications')
"
```

### Applications Not Showing in Frontend

**Check 1: Refresh Page**
- Click "REFRESH" button in Applications page
