# AI Tailored Resume Feature - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a full AI-powered tailored resume generation system that integrates with the existing worker's AI materials to create custom resumes for specific job applications.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Backend Endpoint** (`backend/app/main.py`)

#### `POST /applications/{application_id}/generate-tailored-resume`

**Purpose**: Generate a custom, job-specific resume using:
- User's original resume
- Job description
- AI-generated match analysis from the worker
- Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM

**Request**:
```json
{
  "application_id": "uuid-of-application",
  "user_id": "uuid-of-user"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "application_id": "...",
  "job_title": "Full Stack Developer",
  "company": "Tech Corp",
  "original_resume": "...",
  "tailored_resume": "...",
  "changes_made": [
    "Added 15 relevant keywords from job description",
    "Emphasized: Full-stack development experience",
    "Reorganized and optimized existing content for better job match"
  ],
  "success": true,
  "message": "Tailored resume generated successfully"
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Validates application has AI materials (`materials_ready` status)
- ✅ Fetches user's original resume from database
- ✅ Uses comprehensive Gemini prompt with:
  - Original resume
  - Job description & requirements
  - AI match analysis (score, strengths, areas to address)
- ✅ **CRITICAL SAFETY**: AI is explicitly instructed NOT to invent experience
- ✅ Analyzes changes made (keyword additions, content adjustments)
- ✅ Full error handling and logging

### 2. **Frontend API Client** (`frontend/lib/api.ts`)

Added `generateTailoredResume()` method:
```typescript
async generateTailoredResume(applicationId: string, userId: string) {
  const response = await api.post(`/applications/${applicationId}/generate-tailored-resume`, {
    application_id: applicationId,
    user_id: userId
  })
  return response.data
}
```

---

### 3. **Frontend Resume Drafting Page** (`frontend/pages/dashboard/drafts.tsx`)

#### **New State Management**:
- `materialsReadyApps`: List of applications with AI materials
- `selectedApplicationId`: Currently selected application
- `generatingResume`: Loading state during generation
- `tailoredResume`: Generated custom resume text
- `changesMade`: List of AI modifications
- `showTailoredView`: Toggle between selection and preview

#### **New Functions**:

1. **`fetchMaterialsReadyApplications()`**
   - Fetches all user's `materials_ready` applications from Supabase
   - Includes job details and AI artifacts
   - Runs on page load

2. **`generateTailoredResume()`**
   - Calls backend endpoint
   - Shows loading state
   - Stores results and switches to preview view

3. **`downloadTailoredResume()`**
   - Downloads tailored resume as `.txt` file
   - Filename: `resume_{company}_{job_title}.txt`

4. **`copyTailoredResume()`**
   - Copies tailored resume to clipboard
   - Shows success toast notification

## 🔄 User Workflow

### **Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **User uploads resume** → Parsed and saved in `resumes` table
2. **User scrapes jobs** → Jobs saved in `jobs` table
3. **User queues applications** → Applications created with `draft` status
4. **AI Worker runs** → Generates match analysis, cover letter → `materials_ready` status
5. **User goes to Resume Drafting tab**
6. **Dropdown shows all `materials_ready` applications**
7. **User selects a job** (e.g., "Full Stack Developer at Tech Corp (Match: 85/100)")
8. **Clicks "GENERATE TAILORED RESUME WITH AI"**
9. **Backend**:
   - Fetches application's AI materials
   - Retrieves user's original resume
   - Sends to Gemini 2.5 Pro with comprehensive prompt
   - AI creates tailored version (emphasizes strengths, adds keywords)
10. **Frontend displays**:
    - Original resume (left)
    - Tailored resume (right)
    - List of changes made
11. **User can**:
    - Copy tailored resume to clipboard
    - Download as `.txt` file
    - Select a different job to generate another version

## 🔒 Safety & Ethical Considerations

### **AI Prompt Safeguards**:

```
**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Do NOT invent or fabricate any experience, skills, or qualifications
2. ONLY reorganize, emphasize, and reword EXISTING information
3. Keep the same resume structure (sections, order)
4. Add relevant keywords from the job description naturally
5. Highlight experiences that match the job requirements
6. Make sure all claims remain truthful to the original resume
```

### **Backend Comments**:
```python
"""
IMPORTANT: The AI does NOT invent experience. It only reorganizes and emphasizes
existing qualifications to better match the job requirements.
"""
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Database Requirements**:
- `applications` table with `status` = 'materials_ready'
- `applications.artifacts` JSONB with `match_analysis` and `cover_letter`
- `resumes` table with user resumes
- `jobs` table with job descriptions

### **API Dependencies**:
- Gemini AI API (configured with `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- Supabase (with service role key for RLS bypass)

### **Models Used**:
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for tailored resume generation
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for worker's match analysis (prerequisite)

   - Cyan/Green: Tailored resume (success)
   - Gray: Original resume (neutral)
3. **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based comparison view
