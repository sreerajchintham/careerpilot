2025-10-17 03:48:20,764 - gemini_apply_worker - INFO - AI recommends not applying: The candidate's resume shows a strong background in IT management, data analytics, and general software/AI tools, coupled with finance and customer service skills. However, there is a fundamental and **FOREMOST** mismatch with the 'Director of Hardware Test Engineering' role, which requires deep expertise and leadership experience in hardware testing, quality, and reliability. The absence of *any* provided work experience, combined with an education and skill set that does not align with hardware engineering, makes this an unsuitable match.

2025-10-17 03:48:44,651 - gemini_apply_worker - INFO - AI recommends not applying: The candidate's resume lacks critical information regarding professional experience, and explicitly required web development skills (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React/Angular) are not mentioned. While the candidate possesses strong general software engineering, data, and communication skills, these do not directly address the core web application development focus of the role without demonstrated experience and specific technical proficiencies.

2025-10-17 03:49:02,778 - gemini_apply_worker - INFO - AI recommends not applying: The candidate's resume lacks the fundamental blockchain-specific skills (smart contracts, blockchain infrastructure) and the professional experience required for a 'Senior Blockchain Engineer' position. While general software engineering and analytical skills are present, they do not compensate for the absence of core domain expertise and a proven track record in blockchain.

2025-10-17 03:49:19,227 - gemini_apply_worker - INFO - AI recommends not applying: The candidate's resume critically lacks a required '3+ years of experience in software development' and does not explicitly list proficiency in core technical skills (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) essential for web application development. While education is strong and some general software engineering skills are present, these major gaps make it a poor match for the stated requirements without significant resume updates.

2025-10-17 03:54:41,746 - gemini_apply_worker - INFO - AI recommends not applying: While the candidate has strong academic credentials and foundational technical skills (Python, SQL), the resume critically lacks any stated experience in software development and specific full-stack technologies (especially frontend frameworks and deployment tools). The 'Contractor - Full Time' nature of the role strongly implies a need for demonstrable, hands-on experience, which is entirely absent. Applying without addressing these core gaps would likely result in immediate disqualification.
